- 👋 Hi, I’m @sabbadoo32, legally known as Sebastian James
- 👀 I’m interested in Watson NLU to build better customer profiles, personas and Voter IDs. I'm looking for solutions/someone to assist with tweaking PersonalityInsights Python code for use in IBMs new NLU product.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that coyp/pasting IBM Watson template code doesn't always work. I tried tweaking the above myself, using IBM resourses. Time to consult with smarter people.
- 💞️ I need to find "a guy (or gal)" knowledgable with Watson and Python for ongoing, relatively straight-forward and easy (I hope) paid work.
- 📫 How to reach me is sebastian.james@digitalstrategy.group
